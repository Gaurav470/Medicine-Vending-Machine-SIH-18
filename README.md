# Medicine-Vending-Machine-SIH-18

This was our problem statement for Smart India Hackathon'2018-Finals held between 17th to 21st June,2018
We are creating a database of doctors as well as patients to keep them connected for better service.  
We have created a Web App as well as an Android app to help them keep track of the prescriptions as
well their health records. The apps will consist a QR Code related to the medicine assigned to them
with its quantity. The user will show the QR code as a printout or in the app itself in front of the 
machine. The machine will ask them to make the payment to get that medicine. As soon as the user 
makes the payment, the QR code will be decoded from the captured image of it and the corresponding 
motors according to the meds assigned and in quantity will become active and dispense out the 
medicine in the collection box.
